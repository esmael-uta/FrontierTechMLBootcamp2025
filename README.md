# Frontier Tech Leaders Machine Learning Bootcamp 2025

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the **3-month Machine Learning Bootcamp** offered by Frontier Tech Leaders! This repo serves as a central hub for all my work during the program, including assignments, coding challenges, and the final capstone project. My goal is to document my learning journey, showcase practical applications of machine learning, and build a portfolio of real-world ML skills.

## About the Bootcamp
The Frontier Tech Leaders Machine Learning Bootcamp is an intensive 3-month program designed to equip participants with cutting-edge ML skills. Through hands-on assignments, competitive challenges, and a capstone project, Iâ€™ll explore topics like Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning to Leadership and Entrepreneurship..

- **Duration**: 3 months (February 27 2025 - May 2025)  
- **Focus**: End-to-end machine learning, from data preprocessing to production-ready models  
- **Tools**: Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and more  

## Repository Structure
This repo is organized to keep my work tidy and accessible:
- **`assignments/`**: Weekly coding assignments from the bootcamp.
- **`challenges/`**: Solutions to timed coding challenges or mini-projects.
- **`capstone/`**: My final capstone project, including code, data, and documentation.
- **`notebooks/`**: Exploratory Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and learning.
- **`docs/`**: Additional notes, resources, or write-ups.

## Goals
- Master machine learning fundamentals and advanced techniques.
- Build and deploy ML models using industry-standard tools.
- Create a standout capstone project to demonstrate my skills.
- Track my progress and reflect on my growth as an ML practitioner.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python, SQL  
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn  
- **Tools**: Jupyter, Git, Docker  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## How to Navigate
- Check the `assignments/` folder for weekly tasks with individual READMEs explaining each solution.
- Explore `challenges/` for quick, creative ML solutions.
- Dive into `capstone/` for a deep dive into my final project once completed.
